# Online Course Rental Platform
Developed the backend of an online course rental platform in node.js using MongoDB as the database. Custom endpoints were developed to correspond to specific website features. JSON Web Tokens and hashed passwords were used to restrict access to administrator endpoints. Integration and unit tests were implemented to ensure error-free code while implementing changes and adding new features. Error handling and logging was also implemented.
