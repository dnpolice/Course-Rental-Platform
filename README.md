# Online-Store-Backend
Designed the backend of an online store in node.js using MongoDB as the database. Custom endpoints were developed to correspond to specific website features. The wesbsite was made secure through a combination of hashing passwords with a custom key and JSON Web Tokens restricting access to specific endpoints. Error handling was implimented with loggers to cover both async and synchronous errors that occur anywhere throughout the website.
